To waltz, turn left turn right then turn left
To tango, turn right step forward step backward then turn left
To swing, step forward turn right turn left then step backward
To riff, thump thump thump then crash
To dance, waltz and riff then tango and riff then swing and riff
If you see a yellow object, dance

You see a yellow object
